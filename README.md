# Ignitebase
Ignitebase is a Couchbase Inspired Database & InMemory Grid Platform Powered by Apache Ignite and GraalVM/GraalJS

## Why?
We wanted to use NPM Modules and Javascript / ECMAScript Code on a InMemory grid to Create a new Generation of Databases that do not get used with clients they are Standalone Applications. MemcacheD and NodeJS was to slow as it got to much Serialization Overhead. But ECMAScript and JavaScript are still the prefered Languages.

## How?
We use the ES4X Concepts and Learnings from VertX it is a Java Factory for GraalJS wrapped with the vertx async layer. It Compiles well down to substrateVM binarys

## Features?
- Secure Encapsulated 
- Fastest Possible Zero Overhead Distributed in Memory Computing
- Reduces Latency 

## Who is it for?
- Distributed Computing on Demand or as a Service
- High Traffic Websites & Applications 
- Fast Development of Custom Database Solutions that do Easy Scale.

## Examples?
```js
