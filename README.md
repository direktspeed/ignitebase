# Ignitebase
Ignitebase is a Couchbase Inspired Database & InMemory Grid Platform Powered by Apache Ignite and GraalVM/GraalJS

## Why?
We wanted to use NPM Modules and Javascript / ECMAScript Code on a InMemory grid to Create a new Generation of Databases that do not get used with clients they are Standalone Applications. MemcacheD and NodeJS was to slow as it got to much Serialization Overhead. But ECMAScript and JavaScript are still the prefered Language. The Concept Behind Ignitebase how ever allows to use any GraalVM Supported Language to Interop with the Server.

On The Long run Our Goal is to Replace Kubernetes ETCD with Ignitebase to Bundle even Kubernetes API's and Services Directly into Ignitebase as a Simple module.

## How?
We use the ES4X Concepts and Learnings from VertX it is a Java Factory for GraalJS wrapped with the vertx async layer. It Compiles well down to substrateVM binarys

## Features?
- Secure Encapsulated 
- Fastest Possible Zero Overhead Distributed in Memory Computing
- Reduces Latency 
- Run Services With Optimal Performance via Autotune Bayesian optimization algorithm to squeze out even more performance on any hardware.


## Who is it for?
- Distributed Computing on Demand or as a Service
- High Traffic Websites & Applications 
- Fast Development of Custom Database Solutions that do Easy Scale.

## Examples?
```js
